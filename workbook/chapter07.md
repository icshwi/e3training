# Chapter 7: Understanding module dependence

[Return to Table of Contents](README.md)

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Understand which e3 environment variables that define module dependency.
* Understand the dependency chain during module building.
* Change dependency versions when a module needs to be recompiled.
* Make more informed decisions when deciding on module versions.

---

## Dependent environment variables

Go to `e3-StreamDevice/`, run `make vars`, and try to find `*_DEP_VERSION` in the output.

> These variables are defined in `configure/CONFIG_MODULE` and `StreamDevice.Makefile`.

```console
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ more configure/CONFIG_MODULE | grep "DEP"
ASYN_DEP_VERSION:=4.33.0
PCRE_DEP_VERSION:=8.41.0
```

```console
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ more StreamDevice.Makefile | grep "DEP_VERSION"
ifneq ($(strip $(ASYN_DEP_VERSION)),)
asyn_VERSION=$(ASYN_DEP_VERSION)
ifneq ($(strip $(PCRE_DEP_VERSION)),)
pcre_VERSION=$(PCRE_DEP_VERSION)
```

You now know where these variables are defined, but where are they used in the compilation process (`make build`)? Have a look:

```bash
/usr/bin/gcc  -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE         -DUSE_TYPED_RSET               -DUSE_TYPED_RSET   -D_X86_64_  -DUNIX  -Dlinux                 -MD   -O3 -g   -Wall                    -mtune=generic     -m64 -fPIC                -I. -I../src/ -I.././src/    -I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.33.0/include                        -I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/pcre/8.41.0/include         -I/epics/base-3.15.5/include  -I/epics/base-3.15.5/include/compiler/gcc -I/epics/base-3.15.5/include/os/Linux                                    -c .././src/StreamVersion.c

/usr/bin/g++  -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE         -DUSE_TYPED_RSET               -DUSE_TYPED_RSET   -D_X86_64_  -DUNIX  -Dlinux                 -MD   -O3 -g   -Wall                    -mtune=generic     -m64 -fPIC               -I. -I../src/ -I.././src/    -I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.33.0/include                        -I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/pcre/8.41.0/include         -I/epics/base-3.15.5/include  -I/epics/base-3.15.5/include/compiler/gcc -I/epics/base-3.15.5/include/os/Linux                                    -c ../src/RegexpConverter.cc
```

Especially note:

```
-I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.33.0/include
-I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/pcre/8.41.0/include
```

And if we unset one of these variables and try to rebuild:

```console
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ echo "ASYN_DEP_VERSION:=" > configure/CONFIG_MODULE.local
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ make clean
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ make build

```

If you look at this output, you'll find that `-I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.33.0/include` now is missing. At this point, the building system cannot find `asynDriver.h` (which is used in `src/AsynDriverInterface.cc`). 

Roll back the *asynDriver* (henceforth *asyn*) version and rebuild:

```console
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ rm configure/CONFIG_MODULE.local
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ make clean
[iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ make build
```

## New dependency module

If we postulate that we (due to new requirements or critical bugs in an existent IOC) need to swap from *StreamDevice* version `2.7.14p` to `2.8.4`, we have to consider two dependency modules (*asyn* and *pcre*). Here, for the sake of brevity, we will only consider the *asyn* dependence. Before swapping, we need to consider if the existing *asyn* module is both sufficient for our needs and compatible with *StreamDevice* `2.8.4`.

* If it is, recall what we did in [Chapter 3](chapter03.md).

  > Note that this makes a strong assumption that the list of source files in `2.7.14p` and `2.8.4` are the same. If some files have been added or removed between the versions, we have to modify `StreamDevice.Makefile` accordingly. Whenever this is the case, contact the maintainer of e3.

* If it isn't, we have to install a new *asyn* version using our current e3 environment. The procedure is here the same with *StreamDevice* in [Chapter 3](chapter03.md). In our case, there are neither new files nor deleted files between *asyn* versions `4.33` and `4.34`, and we can thus build the new version of asyn with the same `asyn.Makefile`:

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ make vars
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ make existent
  /epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn
  └── 4.33.0
      ├── db
      ├── dbd
      ├── include
      └── lib
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ echo "EPICS_MODULE_TAG:=tags/R4-34" > configure/CONFIG_MODULE.local
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ echo "E3_MODULE_VERSION:=4.34.0" >> configure/CONFIG_MODULE.local
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ make vars
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ make init
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ make rebuild
  [iocuser@host:e3-asyn]$ make existent
  /epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn
  ├── 4.33.0

  │   └── lib
  └── 4.34.0
      ├── db
      ├── dbd
      ├── include
      └── lib
  ```

  Next, we can install *StreamDevice* `2.8.4`, which will be using *asyn* `4.34.0`.

  > This step is exactly the same as we what did in [Chapter 3](chapter03.md).

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-StreamDevice/ existent
  make: Entering directory '/home/iocuser/e3-3.15.5/e3-StreamDevice'

  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-StreamDevice  vars 
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-StreamDevice/ init
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-StreamDevice/ rebuild
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ $ make -C e3-StreamDevice/ existent
  make: Entering directory '/home/iocuser/e3-3.15.5/e3-StreamDevice'

      └── SetSerialPort.iocsh

  make: Leaving directory '/home/iocuser/e3-3.15.5/e3-StreamDevice'
  ``` 

  Here it is good to validate that *StreamDevice* `2.8.4` can be loaded.

  > Remember that you can initiate an IOC shell just like `iocsh.bash -r stream,2.8.4`.

  > Can you see the *asyn* version you've just set up in the output? Try loading *StreamDevice* version `2.7.14p` to compare.

  As you have just seen, dependencies are defined when we compile the module.

## Aggressive tests

More technical pitfalls exist when we are building or writing startup scripts. Here we will see some combinations which the current *require* module fails to handle properly.

> If you find further cases, please inform the e3 maintainer.

* How modules are loaded.

  Let's first uninstall the `2.8.4` version.

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-StreamDevice/ uninstall
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-StreamDevice/ existent
  ```

  Let's try to load the module:

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ iocsh.bash -r stream,2.7.14p
  ```

  What do you see? What if we don't define a specific version number of the `stream` module?

  > Remember: `iocsh.bash -r stream`.

  And what happens if we do the same after `make install` and `make vars`? (Test it.)

  What you have just seen is the default behavior when a module version number isn't specified; loading a module with no specified version will **only** work when the system has a numeric `X.Y.Z` version. In our last example, the system has *StreamDevice* version `2.8.4`, which **is** numeric, but `2.7.14p` is **not** numeric.
  
  > Also note that, in either of these cases, the *StreamDevice* module will use the version of *asyn* which was specified when building the *StreamDevice* module. 

* How we require dependency modules within startup scripts.

  Have a look at the differences between the startup scripts in `ch7_supplementary_path`:

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-1.cmd
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-2.cmd
  ```

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-3.cmd 
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-4.cmd
  ```

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-5.cmd 
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-6.cmd 
  ```

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-7.cmd 
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-8.cmd
  [iocuser@host:e3training]$ iocsh.bash ch7_supplementary_path/7-9.cmd
  ```

## Identify potential risks early

The current implementation of e3 can't handle these aforementioned cases properly (technically it is *require* that cannot). We must thus attempt to mitigate them, in part by following best practice when writing startup script. 

* Use specific version numbers for modules. That way if something wrong you will not be able to start the IOC.

* Use the highest version dependency module that you know will work. In the above examples, this would mean only using `stream`, and not both `asyn` and `stream` (as *StreamDevice* already depends on *asyn*).

## Dependence, dependence, and dependence

In this chapter, we only discuss one kind of dependency that arises when compiling a module, a so-called *build time dependency*. That is, the module `stream` uses functions which are defined in the `asyn` header files. We can see these in certain files that are generated at build-time:

```
e3-StreamDevice/StreamDevice/O.3.15.5_linux-x86_64/AsynDriverInterface.d: 
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynDriver.h \
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynOctet.h \
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynInt32.h \
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynUInt32Digital.h \
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynGpibDriver.h \
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynDriver.h \
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/asyn/4.34.0/include/asynInt32.h \
```

By contrast, we also can have *run-time dependencies*. These often arise in particular with *StreamDevice*, and are in this case often signified by the existence of protocol files (`*.proto`), but they can also result from needing to use functionality from another module at run time, for example if you need to use the function `drvAsynIPPortConfigure` during your startup script.

In both cases, the module (*StreamDevice*, in this case) must load the correct version of the dependent module (*asyn*, in this case) when the IOC starts up.

---

## Assignments

* Think about how you figure out which versions of modules are available to you.
* What would a version that looks like `2.8.4-1` mean and imply?
