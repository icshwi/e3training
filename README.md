# European Spallation Source EPICS Environment e3 training

This is a training series for using ESS' EPICS environment [e3](https://github.com/icshwi/e3). 

The series assumes at least familiarity with EPICS, albeit you may be able to follow along regardless.

## Primer on e3

ESS' EPICS Environment, also known as e3, is essentially a configuration management system, intended to a) facilitate development by abstracting away some of the low-level complexities intrinsic to large EPICS implementations (dependencies), and b) allow for more manageable quality control of released modules. It allows for easily building EPICS modules directly from source, and automagically resolves module dependencies. Thus, e3 aims to simplify the work for primarily two groups: EPICS integrators, and a central core group that oversees module interdependencies.

## Workbook

Note that this workbook is intended for e3 app developers and integrators at ESS (and consequently also contains some site specific processes and standards); if you simply want to use EPICS to read or manipulate PVs you can either run the first two installation commands, or e.g. install EPICS base using conda from conda-forge.

This workbook is a work-in-progress and is therefore still missing information. Please create an issue or submit a pull request with a suggested change if you noticy something being awry or have an improvement in mind.
