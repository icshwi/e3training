# Chapter 4: Delve into e3 with startup scripts

[Return to Table of Contents](README.md)

## Lesson overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Build the startup script for an IOC in e3.
* Understand different methods of using EPICS functions within startup scripts.
* Understand the local setup for *database* and *protocol* files.
* Add common (global) modules to the IOC.

---

## A simulated serial device

We will use a simple simulator based on *[Kameleon](https://bitbucket.org/europeanspallationsource/kameleon)* to simulate a serial device, accessible by use of e.g. telnet. More specifically, we will use a forked version, which is already linked into this workbook repository as a git submodule. To fetch it, run:

```console
[iocuser@host:e3training]$ git submodule update --init
```

> The device that the simulator is based on as well as an EPICS IOC to go with it can be found at https://github.com/jeonghanlee/gconpi. However, all files necessary for this lesson are already included in this workbook.

*N.B.! Kameleon was written for Python2 (tested on 2.7), so make sure you have that installed.*

> Before continuing, you should clone this very tutorial's repository if you haven't already:
> 
> ```console
> [iocuser@host:~]$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/icshwi/e3training
> ```

1. Open a new terminal and go to `~/e3training/ch4_supplementary_path`.

2. Run:

   ```console
   [iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_training]$ ./simulator.bash
   ```

3. Open another terminal, and connect to the simulator using telnet:

   ```console
   [iocuser@host:~]$ telnet 127.0.0.1 9999
   ```

4. You should be able to interact with the simulator. <!-- try out first -->

5. End the telnet connection 

   ```console
   ^]
   telnet> quit
   Connection closed.
   ```

   (where ^ is the Ctrl key.)

> The simulator in question has shown a tendency to die every now and then, so go back to verify that the simulator is working before trying out a script - and restart it if not.

## Startup scripts

In `ch4_supplementary_path/cmds`, you will find a number of (incrementally named) startup scripts that will be used for the following steps.

For each of these scripts, you should attempt to first figure out what is happening, or what will happen, before continuing this tutorial. And whenever a question is asked, attempt to answer it before reading the next sentence.

> Before running `iocsh.bash`, don't forget to load your e3 environment:
> 
> ```console
> [iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_training]$ source ~/e3-3.15.5/tools/setenv
> ```
>
> (or by sourcing `SetE3Env.bash` - do you remember where that was located?) 

### 0.cmd

Execute the first script:

```console
[iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_training]$ iocsh.bash cmds/0.cmd
```

* Did it work?
* Can you explain why?
* Could you fix this startup script?

#### Variables

* Can you see `E3_IOCSH_TOP` and `E3_CMD_TOP`?
* How are these two variables changed if you instead execute `iocsh.bash` from within `cmds/`?:

```console
[iocuser@host:cmds]$ iocsh.bash 0.cmd 
```

* What is `0.cmd` in this context?

  > `0.cmd` is used as an argument for `iocshLoad` internally. Inspect the following line:
  >
  > ```bash
  > iocshLoad '0.cmd',''
  > ```

### 1.cmd

Execute the next script.

* How many dependency modules of stream are loaded? Look carefully at the output:

  ```console
  [iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_training]$ iocsh.bash cmds/1.cmd
  iocshLoad 'cmds/1.cmd',''
  require stream,2.8.8

  ```

* Is it what we defined? How would we check that?

  > ```console
  > [iocuser@host:e3-StreamDevice]$ make vars
  > ```

  *Note `ASYN_DEP_VERSION` and `PCRE_DEP_VERSION`. These dependencies will be described in more detail later on.*

  > We can print these variables more easily with `make dep`.

### 2.cmd

Execute the next script:

```console
[iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_training]$ iocsh.bash cmds/2.cmd
```

* What is `iocInit`?

> If you do not know, you might want to spend some time with the [EPICS Application Developer's Guide](https://epics.anl.gov/base/R3-15/5-docs/AppDevGuide/IOCInitialization.html#x8-2750007.4).

* What is the difference between `1.cmd` and `2.cmd`?

  > e3's `iocsh.bash` will check if `iocInit` is defined within a startup script, and, if it isn't, it will be added automatically. You should, however, always specify `iocInit` explicitly as some functions should be executed after `iocInit`. 

* Can you spot the warning? And can you explain what kind of warning it is?

*N.B.! Each line in the output of the IOC is important. You should always be careful to ensure that everything looks correct.*

### 3-1.cmd

Execute the next command:

```console
[iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_training]$ iocsh.bash cmds/3-1.cmd 
```

* The IOC is running, but it doesn't connect to anything. Can you see anything in the output that explains this?

  > Beware that the application launches regardless of if it finds hardware or not. In `3-1.cmd` there are no `.db.`-files to specify records and fields, which is why no errors appear.

This script contains the correct *Asyn* configuration for the simulated device:

```bash
drvAsynIPPortConfigure("CGONPI", "127.0.0.1:9999", 0, 0, 0)
```

### 3-2.cmd

This script contains a fully working IOC - inspect it thouroughly.

* Can you find the warning? 
* How does this script use `E3_CMD_TOP`? Is it useful to define where other files are? 
* What is the *stream protocol* file? 

### 4.cmd

By now we have a functioning IOC which can communicate with our simulated device. We would, however, generally want to tie more EPICS modules into that IOC, such as `iocStats`, `autosave`, and `recsync`. For this, we will need the specific module's name, its' version, as well as its' corresponding configuration files (database files and so forth).

Execute the next script:

```console
[iocuser@host:ch4_supplementary_path]$ iocsh.bash cmds/4.cmd
```

1. Type `dbl` to see the IOC's PVs.
2. Get the *heartbeat* of your IOC:

   ```
   350b5cb.kaffee.4355 > dbpr IOC-80159276:IocStat:HEARTBEAT
   ```

   > The number `80159276` is here randomly generated. If you happen to see the same number on your machine, today is your lucky day!

3. Look at the heartbeat again. Is it the same? Why not?

Spend some time thinking about the following:

* `epicsEnvSet` Can you see two different ways for it to be used? 

* Can you think of another syntax by which you can call `dbLoadRecords`?

* Could you rewrite startup scripts using only one method? 

### 5.cmd

Here we add `iocStats` in a slightly different way, and have furthermore added more default e3 modules.

0. Go to **E3_TOP** and run the following commands:

    ```console
   [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-iocStats/ existent
   [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-recsync/  existent
   [iocuser@host:e3-3.15.5]$ make -C e3-autosave/ existent
   ```

   * Can we see the `*.iocsh` files with the installation path of e3?

   The e3 function `loadIocsh` is a function similar to EPICS' function `iocshLoad`. It supplies us with a reusable modularized startup script to simplify development.

   > `loadIocsh` can of course still be used, but `iocshLoad` is highly recommended. 

1. Run the following command to print your PVs, and inspect the output file:

   ```console
   [iocuser@home:ch4_supplementary_path]$ bash ../tools/caget_pvs.bash -l IOC-NNNNNNNN_PVs.list 
   ```

   (where `NNNNNNNN` is your IOC's random number.)

## Assignments

* Could you improve on the startup script further? Explain to yourself how.
* What does the `-C` flag do when used with make rules?
