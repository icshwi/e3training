# European Spallation Source EPICS Environment e3 training

This is a training series for using ESS' EPICS environment [e3](https://github.com/icshwi/e3). 

The series assumes at least familiarity with EPICS, albeit you may be able to follow along regardless.

## Primer on e3

ESS' EPICS Environment, also known as e3, is essentially a configuration management system, intended to a) facilitate development by abstracting away some of the low-level complexities intrinsic to large EPICS implementations (dependencies), and b) allow for more manageable quality control of released modules. It allows for easily building EPICS modules directly from source, and automagically resolves module dependencies. Thus, e3 aims to simplify the work for primarily two groups: EPICS integrators, and a central core group that oversees module interdependencies.
